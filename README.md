# Vertical Carousel using React
-----------------------------
Jade and Babel combine to make this  carousel work with background images, panel background color and panel content all change.  Still tweaking the colors. Learned to CSS transitions to fade between slides back in April with the Donut API. All passages are from the Project Gutenberg transcript of Fables.
